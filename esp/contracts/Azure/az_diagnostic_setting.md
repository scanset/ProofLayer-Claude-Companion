# az_diagnostic_setting

## Overview

**Read-only, control-plane-only.** This CTN validates a single named
Azure diagnostic setting attached to a target resource (Key Vault, NSG,
Storage Account, SQL server, etc.) via a single Azure CLI call —
`az monitor diagnostic-settings show --name <setting>
--resource <target ARM ID> [--subscription <id>] --output json`. Returns
destination scalars (Log Analytics workspace, Event Hub, Storage
Account, Marketplace), per-category log + metric record arrays, and
derived counts for enabled/disabled categories and destination
population.

Diagnostic settings are child resources scoped by their parent's ARM
resource ID — this CTN's OBJECT therefore takes a `resource_id` +
`setting_name` pair rather than the single-name shape used by other
Azure CTNs. Subscription-level activity-log diagnostic settings are a
separate API surface with a different response shape
(`{value:[...]}` vs bare `[...]`) and are **out of scope** for this
CTN.

**Platform:** Azure (requires `az` CLI binary on PATH, authenticated via
any supported mode — see `az_resource_group.md` for the full env-var
matrix)
**Collection Method:** Single Azure CLI command per object via a shared
hardened command executor.
**Scope:** Control-plane only, read-only.

## Environment Variables

All Azure CTNs share a single hardened command executor.
`az_diagnostic_setting` inherits the same env surface as
every other Azure CTN - no per-CTN overrides. See `az_key_vault.md`
for the full env-var table (SPN+secret, SPN+cert, workload identity,
managed identity, cached `az login`, plus `PATH` pin and `az` binary
whitelist).

## Object Fields

| Field          | Type   | Required | Description                                                | Example                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `resource_id`  | string | **Yes**  | Full ARM resource ID of the TARGET resource                | `/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/rg-prooflayer-demo-eastus/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/kv-prooflayer-demo-ybuu` |
| `setting_name` | string | **Yes**  | Name of the diagnostic setting                             | `diag-kv`                                                                                        |
| `subscription` | string | opt      | Subscription ID override                                   | `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`                                                           |

`resource_id` must be a full ARM ID — copy from
`az <service> show --query id -o tsv`. Azure normalizes the returned
`id` field with lowercased provider segments
(`resourcegroups`, `microsoft.keyvault`, `microsoft.insights`); don't
compare against the input verbatim, and the CTN exposes `id` for
traceability, not equality assertions.

---

## Commands Executed

```
az monitor diagnostic-settings show \
    --name diag-kv \
    --resource /subscriptions/.../vaults/kv-prooflayer-demo-ybuu \
    --subscription 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
    --output json
```

One call per diagnostic setting object. `list` is not used — the CTN
operates on a single named setting by design. Policies that need
"resource has at least one setting" semantics should author a separate
OBJECT per known setting name, or a future batch-mode CTN variant.

### Absent-vs-empty semantics

Azure omits optional destination fields entirely (not null, not empty)
when they aren't configured. The collector coalesces absent fields to
empty strings for all destination scalars, then derives the
`has_*_destination` booleans from non-empty. Policies should assert on
the derived booleans, not the string fields, unless they need to match
a specific workspace/storage ID.

---

## RecordData Structure

The full `az monitor diagnostic-settings show` JSON is exposed as the
`resource` field, castable to `RecordData`. Use `record_checks` in ESP
policies for per-category assertions.

### Log / metric entry shape

Each entry in `logs[]` or `metrics[]`:

| Field                        | Type         | Notes                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `category`                   | string / null | e.g. `AuditEvent`, `AzurePolicyEvaluationDetails`, `AllMetrics`   |
| `categoryGroup`              | string / absent | Newer settings may use this instead of `category`               |
| `enabled`                    | bool         |                                                                   |
| `retentionPolicy.enabled`    | bool         |                                                                   |
| `retentionPolicy.days`       | int          | Typically 0 (Azure moved retention to the storage-level policy)   |

**Category vs categoryGroup:** newer diagnostic setting definitions can
use a `categoryGroup` field (`allLogs`, `audit`, etc.) instead of naming
individual categories. The CTN's RecordData exposes both shapes; policy
authors should match whichever applies to the resource type they're
targeting.

---

## State Fields (for ESP STATE blocks)

All scalars listed under Collected Data Fields above are valid state
fields. Plus:

- `record` (RecordData) — used with the `record` / `record_end` block
  inside a STATE for per-category / nested assertions.

Allowed operations:
- **Strings:** `=`, `!=` (all); `contains`, `starts_with` (most fields)
- **Booleans:** `=`, `!=`
- **Integers:** `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`

## Collection Strategy

| Property                 | Value                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Collector Type           | `az_diagnostic_setting`     |
| Collection Mode          | Metadata                    |
| Required Capabilities    | `az_cli`, `reader`          |
| Expected Collection Time | ~2000ms                     |
| Memory Usage             | ~2MB                        |
| Network Intensive        | Yes                         |
| CPU Intensive            | No                          |
| Requires Elevated Privs  | No                          |

---

## Required Azure Permissions

**Unconditional:** `Reader` role at subscription, RG, target-resource,
or diagnostic-setting scope. That's all. `az monitor
diagnostic-settings show` is a pure ARM GET. The reader SPN's
subscription-level Reader grant was confirmed sufficient during
discovery.

## Error Conditions

| Condition                                                     | Collector behavior                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Setting does not exist on a real target resource              | `found=false` - stderr contains `(ResourceNotFound)` "doesn't exist"         |
| Target resource does not exist                                | `found=false` - stderr contains `(ResourceNotFound)` "was not found"         |
| RG does not exist / caller has no access                      | `found=false` - stderr contains `(AuthorizationFailed)` scoped to diag settings |
| Malformed provider namespace in `resource_id`                 | `found=false` - stderr contains `(InvalidResourceNamespace)`                 |
| `az` binary missing / not authenticated                       | Collection failure - bubbles up                                              |
| Unexpected non-zero exit with non-matching stderr             | Collection failure                                                           |
| Malformed JSON in stdout on success                           | Collection failure                                                           |

**NotFound triple-pattern detection:** unlike prior Azure CTNs which had
two NotFound stderr shapes, diagnostic settings have three. The
collector's NotFound detection matches:
1. `(ResourceNotFound)` / `Code: ResourceNotFound` — covers both the
   "setting doesn't exist" and "target resource not found" wordings.
2. `(InvalidResourceNamespace)` / `Code: InvalidResourceNamespace` —
   malformed provider segment of the resource ID.
3. `(AuthorizationFailed)` scoped to `/diagnosticsettings` or
   `microsoft.insights` (case-insensitive) — fake or inaccessible RG.

All three map to `found=false` rather than a collection error, because
from a policy standpoint the effect is identical: the configuration
being asserted on isn't present.

---

## Non-Goals

These are **never** in scope for this CTN. Adding any of them would
break the read-only invariant or the Reader-only permission model:

1. **No setting mutation.** The CTN will never call
   `az monitor diagnostic-settings create`, `update`, or `delete`.
2. **No subscription-level activity log settings.** The
   `az monitor diagnostic-settings subscription` subgroup is a separate
   API with a different response shape (`{value:[]}` wrapper vs bare
   array). A future `az_activity_log_diagnostic_setting` CTN can cover
   it; this CTN stays scoped to resource-level settings.
3. **No cross-setting enumeration.** The CTN validates one named
   setting at a time. Policies that need "resource has at least one
   setting" semantics should enumerate all expected setting names as
   separate OBJECTs, or use a future batch-mode CTN variant.
4. **No category / category-group catalog lookups.** The companion
   `az monitor diagnostic-settings categories` subcommand enumerates the
   set of valid log/metric categories for a given resource type. That's
   a separate concern (schema validation) and out of scope here.

## Related CTN Types

- `az_key_vault`, `az_nsg`, `az_storage_account` — parent resources this
  CTN most commonly attaches to. Use these CTNs to validate the parent
  exists and is hardened, and `az_diagnostic_setting` to validate the
  setting attached to it.
- `az_resource_group` — parent RG context.
- Future `az_log_analytics_workspace` — would validate the sink side
  (workspace retention, solutions installed, etc.) to complement this
  CTN's verification of the source side.
